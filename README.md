<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<p>This is a dynamic web application built using the <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong> framework. It features several important pages and functionalities that allow users to interact with the system effectively. The project includes both <strong>Admin</strong> and <strong>User</strong> panels, with a login system and various features to manage and display user data.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can register and log in through the login panel.</li>
      <li>Session management ensures that users are properly authenticated and authorized to access the necessary sections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The admin panel allows administrators to manage user reservations and testimonials.</li>
      <li>Admins can approve or disapprove reservations and update testimonial content.</li>
      <li>Data is dynamically managed and displayed using the database.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Testimonials:</strong> Users can view testimonials, which are dynamically rendered based on the data stored in the database.</li>
      <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Users can create and view their reservations, with approval statuses managed by the admin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application is built to be responsive and user-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop browsers.</li>
  <li><strong>Swiper Slider Integration:</strong> A dynamic testimonial slider (using Swiper.js) displays the user reviews in a rotating manner with automatic and manual navigation options.</li>
  <li><strong>Database Interaction:</strong> The project uses <strong>Entity Framework</strong> for database operations, allowing for smooth data retrieval, updates, and deletions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong> for the application framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity Framework</strong> for database interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> (Swiper.js) for dynamic content presentation.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> for the frontend, ensuring the app is responsive and user-friendly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Login Panel:</strong> Users and administrators can log in using their credentials. The admin panel allows full control over the reservations and testimonials, while the user panel is more limited to personal interactions (like viewing testimonials and making reservations).</li>
  <li><strong>Admin Controls:</strong> Admins can approve or deny reservations and update testimonial content. The testimonial section uses a swiper slider for dynamic, interactive content presentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The UI is designed to adjust to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone or download the repository.</li>
  <li>Set up the <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong> environment and configure the database.</li>
  <li>Build and run the project.</li>
</ol>
